# StockPathPredictor
This project uses Brownian motion and Monte Carlo simulation to predict stock prices. By modeling random price movements with Brownian motion and applying Monte Carlo methods, it generates multiple potential price paths, providing probabilistic forecasts and helping assess risks in financial markets.
